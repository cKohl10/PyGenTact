Procedural skins are a new class of artificial skins for robotic applications designed to be form-fitting and highly customizable to individual robots and use-cases. Procedural skins utilize a CAD model of a robot to automatically generate sensors with directely tunable parameters such as sensor density and sensing coverage are directly tunable.

# Prerequisites
Procedural skins are designed in [Blender](https://www.blender.org/download/releases/4-1/), then can be optimized or deployed in simulation through [Isaac Sim](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac/sim). The procedural skins developed here use [RC delay capacitive sensing](https://sandrabae.github.io/sensing-network/index.html) and are fabricated using multi-material 3D prinitng. Please refer to the [original paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00711) for more information on fabrication.

# Getting Started

No prerequisite experience with Blender is needed to get started and design your first skin unit. All you need is a CAD model that you plan to cover with skin, then drag and drop the desired components onto the model from the asset browser.

## Blender Procedural Generation Add-on:

Detailed instructions on how to design your first skin unit can be found in the [Blender Procedural Generation Add-on README](procedural_skins_addon/README.md)

## Isaac Sim Contact Extension:
Detailed instructions on how to import your skin unit to Isaac Sim can be found in the [Contact Extension README](isaac_contact_ext/README.md)

# Creating a Custom Procedural Algorithm

The procedural design is built on Blender's geometry node system. You can edit the designs by opening a geometry nodes window and navigating through the premade tabs.
